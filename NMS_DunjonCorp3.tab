# Improved Moldvay Method of DunjonCorp dungeon generator
# 					Noah Stevens
# June 16, 2020 I began to edit previous Moldvay version for better language
# Updated with Mutant Future materials on January 1, 2019
# Added Dismal Crawl Classics items February 10, 2020
# reduced instances of repeats with the excluder functions
# parameterized the number of rooms and added room numbers with a While loop on Dec 8, 2020
# intended to make a weird, futuro-fantasy dungeon a la M. St Claire's Sign of the Labrys
#
## 					Feature wishlist
##
## 2. Difficulty of some traps and saves scales with dungeon level via variable
## 4. Standardized formatting for monsters (bold), treasure (italics)
## 6. Room sizes (Done, partially!), with larger rooms containing larger features
## 7. Random chance of adding a template to a monster - the templates are included not yet fully implemented
## 10. More Steam, Electricity, Magnetism, Flooding, and Wild Organic zones? (highly desired feature!!!)
## 11. Lairs/Settlements of humanoids with leadership, for allies and trading
## 15. Factions of humanoids are the main populants of each level - up to 3 Factions would be cool
## 17. Dataset creator to spit out sorted lists of monsters and magic items after the dungeon is created
## 18. Gold Pieces counter total at the end for XP-for-Gold applications and sanity checking
## 19. Removing big chunks of lists and converting to pseudo-random would remove max rooms limits
## 20. Rooms have a chance of crazy doors, and locked or stuck doors or entrances
