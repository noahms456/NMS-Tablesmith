# November 1, 1, - incidentally the day that the 1, election was decided.
# This is based on Erik Jensen's terrific batch of tables from the Lumberlands'
# freebie called Limited Edition Pumpkin Spice Wampus Country.
# I took some liberties with the format but it works!
# Much love and admiration to Erik and his associate Dr. Lovebeard, purveyor of fine snake oil and other cordials
